CVE-Search-PHP
==============

Search the CVE Database, php script. The script downloads the required files, if not present. You can search the CVE files based on ID or keyword.

I was searching for a **CVE Search** script that I could use locally on my system
without the need to search online. I did find a lot of them on github but all were
Python based and mostly were not so straight forward to install.

So, here is one in *php* that is as simple as:
```bash
cd ${apache-document-root}
git clone <URL>
```

### Salient Features

    1. Download the files if needed.
    2. Search with CVE ID
    3. Search exact match for CVE id.
    4. Search in Descrition and Notes
    5. Search exact match in Descrition and Notes.

### TODO

    1. Add support to search for applications from NVD database.
